# MRTN4110_PhaseD

## Setup

In order to get started working on the PhaseD Project. Ensure you first clone the Git to your workstation.

### Poetry

Poetry is a python package manager that we will be using to ensure we all have the same dependencies installed for our python environments, that all package versions match up, and that everything runs smoothly.

All you need to do to get started with poetry is:

1. Download poetry from this [link][1] and follow the Instructions based on your OS.
2. If you are using OSX/Linux then just run `$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python`
3. Run `$ poetry install` once you've got it all set up, and you're in the PhaseD directory.
4. Get coding!

## File Structure

There are two main directories we'll be working with in this project

### Legacy

Will hold all of the working code from the previous phases, completely unmodified. This is for the purpose of reference.

### src

Will contain the source code for the PhaseD functionality and contain altered versions of these files for phaseD and integration.
